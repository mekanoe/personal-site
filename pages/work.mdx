## things i've worked with

- languages
  - **go** since 2012. it's my favorite language, period; i've been on the train since 1.0.
  - **js** since 2011. old js sucks, but new js... 💝 also flow + typescript. and express. and react. and vue. 
    - and npm install... **oh my god it's 5TB**
  - **html/css** since whenever. duh. css is home. i only complain about it when it's *too* fun.
  - **c#** since 2017. mostly in the context of games, but i appreciate .net core.
  - **c++** since 2018. so, you know, i'm only about that modern c++, 
    - and i also don't know what memory management is.
  - **python** since 2011. never done django but maybe i'm still unchained.
  - **php** since 2010. have done both gross php and laravel. not my style, really.
  - **ruby** a little since 2012. what can i say? it's a weeaboo language.
  - **lua** a little since 2013. openresty is neat.
  - **erlang/elixir** a very tiny amount. beam koolaid. it's tough to shake.

- tools
  - **docker** a lot since 2015. "docker docker docker docker docker docker docker" - internet.
  - **kubernetes.** it's beautiful. and i want more of it. and helm.
  - **makefiles.** for some reason i'm not that bad at them.
  - **elk** stuff. i'm a graph nerd, sue me.
  - **influx** stack. it's been a while but.. graph nerd.
